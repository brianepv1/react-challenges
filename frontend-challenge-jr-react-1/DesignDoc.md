## Objective

_What and why are we doing this?_

- We are doing this challenge to practice our react skill level.
- Improve our problem resolution skill.
- Get even more comfortable with react


## Goals

- Goals

- Implement a User Interface for a simple web application that allows you to take notes, 
tag and filter them.
- Structure the app as a Single Page web Application, which is the classical way of 
implementing User Interface when using vanilla React 
- The usage of a component library like React Bootstrap or Material UI is extremely 
encouraged 
- A set of services, functions/scripts or a state-management library like Redux need to be 
implemented for storing app state - since there will be no backend [Extra]

## Non Goals

- Non-Goals

- Since there will be no backend, content can be persisted in localStorage or in memory

## Background

N / A

## Overview


We need to create differente react component to complete the defined goals.

These are the component overview

_This sections should be understandable by new employees on your team that is not related to the project._

_Put details in the next section._

## Detailed Desing

_Use diagrams where necessary._

_Tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)_

_Cover major changes:_

_- What are the new functions that you will wirte?_

_- Why do you need new components?_

_- Is there any code that can be reusable?_

_Don't elaborate deeply on the implementation details._
